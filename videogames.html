                <h2>Elemental Assault: The Boulder Wars</h2>    
                <p>
                    Elemental Assault: The Boulder Wars is a game developed by Picselica and due to be released on Steam soon. The game is a virtual
                    reality tower defence game, in which the player must wield a variety of bow-based weaponry to fend off elemental soldiers as they
                    attempt to siege the player's tower. Players can unlock weapons through crate drops, and fight in a procedurally generated, low-poly canyon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My role in this game's development was programming/developing the large majority of the game, as well as creating the procedural low-poly terrain system. I also created
                    the logo and VR menu interface. Links to videos and screenshots are provided below.

                <h2>The Research Arcade</h2>
                <p>
                    The Research Arcade Project is an ongoing research project, using student-developed arcade games, at the University of Lincoln.
                    The project currently involves two custom-built arcade machines situated within the university campus. Students and guests of the university
                    are welcome to interact with the machines, and play games. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    My roles within the project involved the design &amp; development of the information site, associated tools, games, blog and the software 
                    which resides on the arcade machines themselves. The interface follows a retro 8-bit aesthetic. The background of the interface is a video clip
                    containing advertisements for various events around the university campus, and student work. Some screenshots of the arcade interface is found below, along with links to the project's website,
                    and blog.

                <h2>Adi's Maze Unlimited</h2>
                <p>
                    Adi's Maze Unlimited is a 2D, 2 player 8-bit pacman clone, built specifically for the Research Arcade project with phaser.js. The design and development
                    of this particular video game was centered around collecting gameplay data of users, for research purposes. Whilst players
                    play the game, playstyle data is recorded throughout their session and saved into an online database for further analysis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Adi's maze features an 8-bit aesthetic, reminiscent of retro arcade cabinets and video games of the 80s. A video link and screenshots of the game can be seen below.

                    <h2>Qong</h2>
                    <p>
                        Qong is a one-player pong clone in which players play pong against themselves, similar to a game of squash. Qong was
                        made in approximately 4 hours in a game jam, built as a game for the Research Arcade project. Player telemetry (such as paddle speed,
                        reaction time and total high-score) is recorded and stored in an online database for further analysis.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The interface design of Qong was designed to suit the 8-bit retro feel of the arcade cabinets, whilst using as an 80s
                        neon colour scheme. Screenshots of the game and its interface can be seen below.

                <h2>RHIB Training Simulator</h2>    
                <p>
                    The RHIB training simulator game is a virtual reality experience in which players drive a realistic RHIB 
                    in an open water environment. The simulation involves varying weather conditions, such as rain, lightning and
                    cross currents which affect the driving of the boat. Players are given a virtual reality headset, with a throttle apparatus, 
                    and are tasked with navigating an obstacle course.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My roles in this project was pretty much everything -- the buoyancy and current physics, shader work for the water, boat control,
                    virtual reality, and so forth.

                <h2>Procedural Galaxy Generator</h2>    
                <p>
                    The procedural galaxy generator is less of a video game, and more of a simulation which users can manually tweak and run. The approach
                    uses Ringermacher's spiral galaxy equation with procedural parameterisation to distribute points (stars) in the shape of a galaxy. Each
                    star is also given a name and metadata (such as the number of planets, and so forth).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The media linked below shows an older version of the galaxy generator, however in the latest version planets are generated for each star
                    procedurally, too. This will be updated soon.

                <h2>Time-line Procedural Settlement Generator</h2>    
                <p>
                    The Time-line procedural settlement generator is a procedural settlement simulation game. The simulation
                    allows users to choose the starting parameters of their settlement, and grows a settlement procedurally over time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This game/simulation was the basis of my MSc by Research thesis, combining the procedural generation of both rural and
                    urban settlements. If you wish to learn more about how this works, a link to the paper is provided below, along with
                    screenshots and a video.
